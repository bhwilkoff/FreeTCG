# [APP NAME] — Claude Code Project Context

## A Note on Why We Build

Before writing a single line of code, take a moment to understand the
orientation of this work. Every feature in this app is built in service of
human learning and growth — not to replace thinking, but to deepen it. At
each decision point, ask: Does this design invite the user to engage more
fully, think more critically, or connect more meaningfully? If a feature
makes a person more passive, reconsider it. If it opens a door to curiosity
or collaboration, prioritize it. The goal is never a slick product — it is a
tool that makes someone more human.

---

## Debugging and Diagnostic Philosophy

**Do not iterate blindly on behavior you cannot observe.** When a feature
does not work correctly and the root cause is not immediately clear from
reading the code, the first move is always diagnostics — not another
implementation attempt.

### Rule: Instrument before iterating

1. **Add console diagnostics immediately.** One round of real data is worth
   more than ten rounds of guessing.
2. **Design diagnostics to answer a specific question.** Write down what you
   expect to see vs. what would indicate the bug.
3. **Isolate layers.** Verify each layer independently before changing any.
4. **For iOS interaction bugs, add a temporary visual overlay** when the user
   cannot easily share a console.
5. **Remove all diagnostics before considering a fix complete.**

## What This App Does

<!-- FILL IN: One paragraph describing what your app does and who it's for -->

This app is available as both a **web app** and a **native iOS app**. The two
platforms are developed separately but maintain **feature parity** as a goal.
When adding a feature to one platform, note in SCRATCHPAD.md whether the
equivalent work is needed on the other.

---

## Platforms

### Feature Parity Model

Both platforms implement the same core feature set. Platform-specific
implementation choices are acceptable and expected. What should stay in sync:

- Which views/features exist
- Core UX flows
- Design language and color tokens
- API usage patterns

---

## Web App

### Tech Stack

- **Rendering:** Vanilla HTML/JS — no framework, no build step required
- **Styling:** Custom CSS (mobile-first, CSS custom properties for theming)
- **API:** <!-- FILL IN: Your API approach -->
- **Auth:** <!-- FILL IN: Your auth approach -->
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages static hosting (branch: main, root: /)

### Key Directories

- `/` — Root: index.html, CLAUDE.md, SCRATCHPAD.md, DECISIONS.md
- `/css/` — Stylesheets (styles.css is the single main stylesheet)
- `/js/` — JavaScript modules (app.js, api.js)
- `/assets/` — Static assets (icons, images)

### How to Run Locally

```
open index.html
# or
python3 -m http.server 8080  # then visit http://localhost:8080
```

### How to Deploy

1. Push changes to `main` branch
2. GitHub Pages serves from root of `main` automatically
3. Live URL: <!-- FILL IN -->

### Web Conventions

- All API calls go through `js/api.js` — never call `fetch` directly from other files
- Auth state is managed exclusively in a single module
- CSS custom properties (variables) are defined in `:root` in `styles.css`
- Mobile-first: all media queries use `min-width` breakpoints
- Semantic HTML throughout — use `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<button>`
- No inline styles — all styling via CSS classes
- Error states must be user-visible (not just console logs)
- **Navigation**: All nav items live inside `#channels-sidebar`
- **IntersectionObserver cleanup**: Any `IntersectionObserver` created for a
  view must be disconnected when leaving that view to prevent memory leaks
- **View system**: Use `showView(name)` to switch between views; each view is
  a `<section>` with `hidden` attribute toggled

### Web Constraints

- GitHub Pages static deployment only — no server runtime, no Node.js
- Zero-cost tools only — no paid APIs, no paid hosting
- No build pipeline — everything must work as plain HTML/CSS/JS

### Do Not Touch (Web)

- `.git/` directory
- GitHub Pages deployment settings

---

## iOS App

### Tech Stack

- **Language / UI:** Swift 6, SwiftUI (`@Observable`, iOS 17+)
- **Local persistence:** SwiftData
- **Auth storage:** Keychain via Security framework
- **API:** <!-- FILL IN: Your API approach -->
- **Fonts:** <!-- FILL IN: Custom fonts if any -->
- **Deployment:** Xcode build → App Store Connect → TestFlight / App Store

### Project Structure — Xcode Cloud Compatible

The `.xcodeproj` lives at the **repository root** so Xcode Cloud finds it
automatically. No subdirectory nesting, no spaces in project names.

```
/                              ← repo root
├── AppName.xcodeproj/         ← Xcode project at root (Xcode Cloud requirement)
├── AppName/                   ← iOS source code
│   ├── App/                   ← Entry point, app delegate
│   ├── Models/                ← Data models
│   ├── Views/                 ← SwiftUI views (one subfolder per feature)
│   ├── Components/            ← Reusable UI components
│   ├── Networking/            ← API client
│   ├── Store/                 ← @Observable global state
│   ├── Resources/Fonts/       ← Custom font files
│   ├── Assets.xcassets/       ← App icons, colors, images
│   └── Info.plist
├── AppVersion.xcconfig        ← Shared version numbers (both targets read this)
├── ci_scripts/                ← Xcode Cloud build scripts
│   └── ci_post_clone.sh
├── index.html                 ← Web app (GitHub Pages serves from root)
├── css/                       ← Web stylesheets
├── js/                        ← Web JavaScript
└── assets/                    ← Shared static assets
```

### How to Create the Xcode Project

1. Open Xcode → File → New → Project → iOS → App
2. Product Name: `AppName` (no spaces — critical for Xcode Cloud)
3. **Save location: the repository root** (not a subdirectory)
4. Interface: SwiftUI, Language: Swift
5. In project settings, add `AppVersion.xcconfig` to both Debug and Release
   configurations (Project → Info → Configurations → set config file)
6. Verify: `AppName.xcodeproj` should be directly in the repo root

### iOS Conventions (Learned from Production)

- All API calls go through a shared client singleton — never call `URLSession` directly from views
- Auth state owned exclusively by one manager — views read via `@Environment`
- Global navigation state lives in an `@Observable` store with `NavigationPath`
- All views use `.toolbarBackground(.regularMaterial, for: .navigationBar)` +
  `.toolbarBackground(.visible, for: .navigationBar)` to prevent content
  scrolling behind the nav bar
- **Sidebar header**: use `VStack` with `.background()` modifier — never a
  `ZStack` with a `Color` sibling (layout-greedy, expands to fill height)
- **fullScreenCover with data**: use `fullScreenCover(item:)` with an
  `Identifiable` carrier struct. Never use `fullScreenCover(isPresented:)` +
  separate `@State` arrays (SwiftUI may evaluate content before state applies)
- **Image grid cells**: always constrain both width AND height before
  `.clipped()`. `scaledToFill()` without width constraint overflows columns
- **VideoPlayer animation crash**: wrap `VideoThumbnailView` (or any view
  containing `AVPlayerViewController`) with `.transaction { $0.animation = nil }`
  to block SwiftUI animation propagation into AVKit
- **Video fullscreen**: present `AVPlayerViewController` directly via UIKit
  `present(_:animated:completion:)` — NOT via SwiftUI `fullScreenCover`.
  Create a fresh `AVPlayer` at current seek position to avoid shared-player conflicts
- **Image resize for uploads**: keep a single shared static resize function.
  Never duplicate resize logic across compose and inline-reply paths
- **Share sheet with Safari**: use `UIActivityViewController` presented via
  UIKit with a custom `UIActivity` subclass for "Open in Safari". SwiftUI's
  `ShareLink` and `.sheet`-wrapped `UIActivityViewController` both suppress
  Safari when presented from within a WKWebView context
- **URLCache**: configure at app launch with large capacity (100 MB memory /
  500 MB disk) to persist `AsyncImage` and `URLSession` responses
- **Seen posts**: use in-memory `@State` `Set<String>` cache instead of
  `@Query` to avoid ForEach cascade re-renders on every SwiftData insert
- **NSFW filtering**: add `isAdultContent` computed property on your post
  model checking labels. Apply in all feed merge steps. Keep search
  intentionally unfiltered (user controls via toggle)
- **Hybrid feeds**: when merging multiple API feeds, fetch in parallel with
  `async let`, deduplicate by URI, sort by trending score. Secondary feeds
  use `try?` so failures never break the primary source
- **Version numbers**: use `AppVersion.xcconfig` at repo root with
  `MARKETING_VERSION` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`. Both targets reference
  it. Never edit versions via the Xcode identity panel (creates per-target
  overrides that cause drift)

### iOS Constraints

- iOS 17+ minimum deployment target
- No third-party Swift packages — use only Apple frameworks
- Keychain for all credential storage — never UserDefaults for secrets

## Standing Instructions for Claude

### Learning Orientation — Six Criteria

Evaluate before implementing any feature:

1. **Does it deepen understanding?** Active engagement, not passive delivery
2. **Does it invite participation?** Ask something of the user
3. **Does it support human agency?** Make people more capable, not dependent
4. **Clarity over cleverness** — simpler implementation always wins
5. **Accessible by default** — WCAG AA from line one
6. **Responsive from the start** — mobile-first, test at 375px before 1440px

### Autonomous Work Guidelines

- When uncertain between approaches, document in DECISIONS.md and choose simpler
- No feature additions beyond what's requested
- Only fix the bug, don't refactor surrounding code
- If a feature conflicts with learning-orientation values, surface the conflict
