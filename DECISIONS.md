# [APP NAME] — Architecture & Technology Decisions

Entries are ordered by date. This file is **append-only** — never edit or
remove past decisions. Platform noted where specific; unlabeled = both.

---

## Decision 001 — Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for Web
*Date: YYYY-MM-DD*

**Decision**: No framework, no build step, no dependencies for the web app.

**Rationale**: GitHub Pages serves static files directly. Framework
abstractions cost more than they save at this scale. Aligns with
clarity-over-cleverness.

**Alternatives considered**: React, Vue, Svelte — all require a build step.

**Trade-offs**: Manual DOM manipulation, no reactive state. Revisit if
component count exceeds ~20.

---

## Decision 002 — Xcode Project at Repository Root
*Date: YYYY-MM-DD*

**Decision**: The `.xcodeproj` lives at the repository root, not in a
subdirectory. Project name has no spaces.

**Rationale**: Xcode Cloud requires `.xcodeproj` at the repository root.
Spaces in paths cause issues with shell scripts, CI/CD, and Xcode Cloud's
project discovery. Lesson learned from Bsky Dreams where
`BskyDreams-iOS/Bsky Dreams/Bsky Dreams.xcodeproj` (two levels deep, spaces)
caused persistent "Project does not exist at root" errors.

**Alternatives considered**: Subdirectory with Xcode Cloud custom workspace
path — fragile, undocumented, breaks on Xcode updates.

**Trade-offs**: Web and iOS files share the same root directory. Use
`.gitignore` to keep build artifacts out of the web deployment.

---

## Decision 003 — Shared Version Config (xcconfig)
*Date: YYYY-MM-DD*

**Decision**: `AppVersion.xcconfig` at repo root defines
`MARKETING_VERSION` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`. All targets reference it.

**Rationale**: Editing version numbers via Xcode's identity panel creates
per-target overrides in `project.pbxproj` that shadow the xcconfig, causing
targets to drift. A single xcconfig is the single source of truth.

**Trade-offs**: Must remember to edit the xcconfig, not the Xcode UI.

---

## Decision 004 — SwiftUI + @Observable + SwiftData (iOS)
*Date: YYYY-MM-DD*

**Decision**: SwiftUI for all UI. `@Observable` (iOS 17 macro) for state
management. SwiftData for local persistence. UIKit only where SwiftUI lacks
a native equivalent.

**Rationale**: Modern Apple stack, minimal boilerplate, no third-party
dependencies.

**Trade-offs**: iOS 17+ minimum deployment target.

---

## Decision 005 — Dual-Platform Feature Parity Model
*Date: YYYY-MM-DD*

**Decision**: Both platforms implement the same core feature set. Track
parity in SCRATCHPAD.md. Platform-specific implementation choices are
acceptable (e.g., Keychain vs localStorage for auth).

**Rationale**: Users expect the same capabilities regardless of platform.
Implementation details can differ to leverage each platform's strengths.

**Trade-offs**: Every feature is effectively built twice. Mitigated by
shared API contracts and design tokens.
